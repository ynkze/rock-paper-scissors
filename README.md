First JavaScript project I done to test out various functions and features.

Available at https://ynkze.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/

## Learning Points
* Take in user input using querySelector and addEventListener
* Return a random array value using Math.random()
* Usage of callback and arrow functions

## Process
1. Create an array of action and a function to output random computer selection.
2. For each button clicked, pass the value into player selection
3. Create a function to take in player selection and computer selection and return message according to outcome.
4. Update and display player score according until 5 points is reached
